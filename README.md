# ImageCompletion
In this code image synthesis is used for image completion. This is a homework from Principles of Image Processing course taught at Sharif University of Technology.

More precisely, in this work we want to remove birds and swimmer from their images. After that we fill their place by textures taken from other parts of the image.
